# Using [LibROSA](https://librosa.github.io)  
 LibROSA is a python package for music and audio analysis , it provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems .

> Out of sound clips provided under `training instances` , 38 of Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients(.mfcc) are extracted/saved and then comapred with the existing presets .

## Content
> [animals](https://github.com/inishchith/SoundAnalysis/tree/master/animals) : A test animal sound clip is fed to the program , it detects and prints the `name of the animal` .

> [voice](https://github.com/inishchith/SoundAnalysis/tree/master/voice) : A test human sound clip is fed to the prgram , it detects and prints the `gender of the speaker` .

> [music](https://github.com/inishchith/SoundAnalysis/tree/master/music) : A test sound piece is fed to the program and it detects which `genre of music` it is .
